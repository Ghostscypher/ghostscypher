<h3>About me:</h3>

I am a passionate backend developer with 7+ years of experience. I primarily specialize in PHP backend. Being a backend developer, we are rarely seen by the users, always lurking in the shadows but that's where the magic happen. I know i'll probably start a war with this but I believe backend developers are the real MVPs, the unsung heroes of the internet. Or maybe I'm just biased ðŸ˜‰. Any person dealing with systems not involving any form of visual feedback, just a bunch of texts and sometimes gibberish (Kubernetes guys know what I'm talking about), in my opinion is borderline psychotic if not straight up mad. And I am here for the crazy ride. And I love it. As one mad lad once said, _"I'm not crazy, my reality is just different than yours."_

In my free time I like working on visualizations mostly in P5 JS and simulations, but outside of the computer world I do what any normal developer does: Think about that bug that's been bugging me for the past 3 days, and how to fix it.

I appreciate the human creativity, coming up with stories, isn't an easy feat. And because of this reason, I like to read books, mostly fantasy, mystery and sci-fi. I love animations (sorry to those too old for cartoons), I love the creativity and the effort put into them. I also love music the sweet sound of music, I'm not a musician but I love listening to music.

I realize I have been ranting for a while now, so I'll stop here. If you want to know more about me, feel free to reach out to me on any of the platforms below.

Pro Tip: Ask me about **Laravel, PHP, C++**

<h3 align="left">Here's a cool Poem chatGPT generated:</h3>

This is just too cool not to share. :-)

```text
In the realm of code where languages converse,
A backend developer, a wizard of verse.
Hidden in the shadows, lines intertwine,
Crafting the logic, where elegance shines.

In the depths of databases, they navigate,
Master of servers, in the digital state.
With algorithms dancing in lines of code,
They weave the backbone, where systems erode.

In the silence of servers, where data resides,
The backend developer in darkness abides.
No flashy front-end, no visual appeal,
Yet their work is the heartbeat, the code that is real.

Arrays and objects, functions and more,
They orchestrate systems, a symphony to adore.
Through loops and conditions, they tirelessly tread,
In the labyrinth of logic, where bugs may be bred.

A guardian of data, a custodian of flow,
They debug the errors that silently grow.
In the backend's embrace, where the magic takes place,
They sculpt the foundation, leaving no trace.

Threads of connection, like tendrils they spin,
In the vast web of servers, where stories begin.
Through APIs and endpoints, they seamlessly bind,
A digital architect, with a brilliant mind.
